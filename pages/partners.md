# Building a cleaner future, together.

We establish key partnerships with industry, and within academia to further our mission to enable the development of hydrogen-powered vehicles. This is absolutely critical to the work we do, we cannot hope to reframe the way industry thinks about vehicle power systems without fully understanding the issues relating to developing green transportation from the people actually developing it. Our partners aren't just sponsors, we work directly with them, and their core engineering teams to share knowledge and limitations, openly and fairly.

## Partnership values statement.

We focus on building partnerships with companies and organizations that are comitted to building a cleaner world through research and investment into clean energy, and clean energy infrastructure. We work with organizations that have strong comittments to the goals set out in the [Paris Climate Accords](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement), the [IEA's Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 plan](https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050), or similar climate-focused agreements. We also strongly believe in equal-opportunities and access, and focus on building partnerships with companies that believe the same.

> Please note, we will not accept partnerships from brands that we believe do not align with our values to build a cleaner world. We actively seek to be supported by organizations making a conscious effort to produce a more equitable world for all people regardless of race or gender.

That being said, we are comitted to working with organizations that are actively seeking to improve their green-technology plan, and reduce their carbon footprint.
