# Building a cleaner future, together.

We establish key partnerships with industry, and within academia to further our mission to enable the development of hydrogen-powered vehicles. This is absolutely critical to the work we do, we cannot hope to reframe the way industry thinks about vehicle power systems without fully understanding the issues relating to developing green transportation from the people actually developing it. Our partners aren't just sponsors, we work directly with them, and their core engineering teams to share knowledge and limitations, openly and fairly.

## Our current organizational needs.

We focus on building partnerships with companies that are addressing our key areas of research in energy storage, hydrogen fuel cell development, hydrogen production and storage, powertrains and motor control, and vehicle development. Currently we are focusing on building partnerships in the following areas.

- __Hydrogen Fuel Cell Manfacturing + Design__, we are looking to work with organizations or academic institutions with experience in Hydrogen Fuel Cell production and design to increase the efficacy of fuel cells and reduce their cost of manufacturing.
- __Hydrogen Generation + Storage__, we are looking to work with organizations or academic institutions with experience in Hydrogen Generation and Storage to develop safety standards for hydrogen vehicles and further research into the production of green hydrogen for vehicles.
- __Power Storage__, we are looking to work with organizations or academic institutions with experience in Power Storage solutions such as Super Capacitor technologies to enable lithium-free vehicles in the future.
- __Powertrains + Motor Control__, we are looking to work with organizations or academic institutions with experience in motors and motor control to develop more efficient power trains tuned for application.

Additionally, we are looking for partners that can provide the following to support our organization's work. 

- __Manufacturing + Facilities Support__, facilities enabling vehicle dynamometer testing and wind tunnel testing, and manufacturing support in metal casting, metal 3D printing, metal fabrication and welding, are all services we need to develop our vehicles and engines.
- __Automotive Part Supply__, our focus is developing hydrogen for the automotive industry. Therefor our test platforms use many automotive parts that come at cost to us. We're looking for a partner interested in providing discounted or sponsored automotive parts such as brake system parts, lights, semiconductor electronics, batteries, and other vehicle components.
- __Logistics Support__, this includes shipping of the vehicle or other delicate parts to racetracks and other facilities for competition or testing.
- __General Funding__, we are always open to general funding to support our operations. Any donations to our work are deeply appreciated and allow us to continue the important work we do as an organization.

> Please note, we will not accept partnerships from brands that we believe do not align with our values to build a cleaner world. We actively seek to be supported by organizations making a conscious effort to produce a more equitable world for all people regardless of race or gender.

That being said, we are comitted to working with organizations that are actively seeking to improve their green-technology plan, and reduce their carbon footprint.
