# We want to support our local community. 



> We want to build the first ever truly open-source, well-documented, rigorously-tested, hydrogen-powered engine to facilitate the development of hydrogen vehicles to bring us towards a more carbon negative future. 

# We offer programs for high-school students grades 9-12.

- High School Summer Internships
- School Visits + Presentations 

# We offer additional community programs for all ages.

- Motorcycle Maintenance Training / Help 

# We offer access to general resources for vehicle development.

We offer the following general resources for vehicle development that the MIT and Cambridge community can access. 

## Motorcycle Dynamometer Tuning

We have a Motorcycle Dynamometer! Dynamometers are used to determine the performance and efficiency of motorcycle systems and also allow the user to tune the performance to the desired specifications. We own and operate a dynamometer which we allow **MIT community members, Cambridge community members, and high-schools to access** depending on availability. 

### Dyno Specs—UPDATE THIS LATER

**Dynamometer Model—** Dynojet 250i Motorcycle Chassis Dynamometer

- 750 Horsepower max torque
- 200 Miles-per-hour max speed
- Eddy current brake absorption + inertial loading 

See full specifications [here](https://www.dynojet.com/motorcycle-chassis-dynamometer-model-250i/).

## Battery Characterization Equipment 

{% include framework/shortcodes/figure.html src="/assets/images/gen/content/battery_char.jpg" title="Impedance Testing of Battery Cells + Packs" caption="(avaliable to the community)" alt="batteries" link="" target="\_blank" %}

We have a lot of equipment to help analyze vehicle batteries including electronic loads for impedance characterization + discharge curve development and impedance matching for battery cells! We offer this equipment to **MIT community members, Cambridge community members, and high-schools** depending on availability.
