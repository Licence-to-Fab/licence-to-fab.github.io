**Unsolicited requests to look at proprietary technology will not be considered and will be reported to the technology's developer.**

Our partners support us and our work, but that does not mean the work they produce is bound by our licensing agreement. Their work is governed by their own IP, and licensing agreements. Please contact them seperately for details.

# Links to Other Websites

Since we're producing documentation, sometimes we will link to resources on the internet that can better explain certain concepts than we can.

# Note on SAFETY

Please note that while we will do our absolute best to release technology that is SAFE, and we will do our best to warn you of all possible dangers relating to the technology, it's important to remember that our work is a large experiment. Safety when dealing with hydrogen gas, lithium batteries, motors, and racing vehicles is absolutely critical.

We will make mistakes, but we'll also fix them together. So we can't offer any compensation for any safety issues that may arise, but we promise to work with you in good faith to fix them. Work with us, and we'll work with you. Report any concerns to [l2f@mit.edu](mailto:l2f@mit.edu) with the subject line "SAFETY."
