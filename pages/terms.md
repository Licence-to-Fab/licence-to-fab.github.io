We aim to be fair and open in all our activities, please read the below for details on the use of our work. For any questions, please email [l2f@mit.edu](mailto:l2f@mit.edu).

# General Licensing of Work

We strongly believe that everything we do should be shared openly and freely with the world. We place exceptions on this policy only in cases to protect our partners, and to address any possible safety concerns with the technology we are developing. Anything that is published on this website *is free,* and falls under a [Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

This means **you can use our work, adapt our work, and share our work.** The only thing we ask in return is **you give credit where credit is due, and you promise to similarly make your additions to our work free, and open-source.** We started this project in an effort to foster collaboration on building a cleaner future. That is why we ask you keep your work open-source as well, so we all may build a cleaner world together.

### Citing our Work

When citing work released by us under [creative-commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), please refer to the [following style guide](https://creativecommons.org/use-remix/attribution/). We ask that you include a link to the original work, a link to our website, and a link to creative-commons.

When citing work by us published in journals, conferences, or similar **please refer to the citation requirements for the scientific formats associated with those journals.**

## Creative Commons

Our work is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) because we believe that science is the prusuit of truth, and truth requires openness, and honesty. We also believe engineering is a team sport, and anyone choosing to use our work to build a better world should be able to do so free-of-charge.

That being said this page is NOT a substitute for the license, please read the [full CREATIVE COMMONS LICENSE here](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode).

Please note that all parts of this license apply to our **publically released work.** Publically released work is work that has been released on this website, or on our [Github page](https://github.com/Licence-to-Fab) **and has a visible creative-commons tag attached to it** <i class="fa-brands fa-creative-commons"></i>.

We will release our work when we believe it is complete and ready to iterated upon, unsolicited requests to prematurely release work will not be considered. This is in our effort to keep you safe, and properly validate the technology we release.

## Exceptions to Creative Commons

There are no exceptions to the creative commons license for resources, methodologies, safety standards, or similar work WE produce. However, we may use technology developed by our partners or other organizations in our work as well. Any technology developed by a third-party will not be documented on this website or released in any way without expressed written permission of the organization that developed it. In addition, the licensing for said technology is at the discretion of the organization that developed it. We will obey the intellectual property (IP) rights and permissions of any technology we use that isn't developed by us without any exceptions. Any technology that we develop with these partners for their expressed, internal research, will also be protected under research agreements between said company, and MIT. 

**Unsolicited requests to look at proprietary technology will not be considered and will be reported to the technology's developer.**

Our partners support us and our work, but that does not mean the work they produce is bound by our licensing agreement. Their work is governed by their own IP, and licensing agreements. Please contact them seperately for details.

### Exceptions to Creative Commons Within our Own Work

We aim to foster a community around hydrogen vehicle development, and our open-source policy reflects those values. However, there are certain sections of our work we will choose to publish in conferences, journals, or other academic avenues as we believe that it will make a greater impact that way. Content published in papers, or theses of students who work in our group will follow the guidelines of those conferences, and the IP rules of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's [Technology Licensing Office](https://tlo.mit.edu). 

**We will be explicit about which content on our website falls under creative commons by placing this symbol next to it.** <i class="fa-brands fa-creative-commons"></i>

# Links to Other Websites

Since we're producing documentation, sometimes we will link to resources on the internet that can better explain certain concepts than we can. Or we'll link to places where we purchased materials required for our work. We are in no way taking credit for any of the work in any of these links, they are to help you.

We promise to try our best to not link to any sketchy websites, but the internet is a scary and dangerous place. Please be careful when leaving this website, and please read the Terms + Conditions of any website we link to for your own safety. 

# MIT Use of Name + Endorsement 

Please note that since we are a student organization under MIT we cannot official endorse you without expressed written permission of MIT. And as a member of MIT, any terms and conditions such as the [MIT Use of Name](https://comms.mit.edu/institute-use-name) also apply to us.

Please use the name, **MIT Electric Vehicle Team (EVT)** when referring to our group or organization. Please see the first section of the Open Source Policy for detailed instructions on how to cite our work.

If you want to work with us or you are confused about the MIT Use of Name policy, please reach out to [l2f@mit.edu](mailto:l2f@mit.edu). You may also [check out our partners page](../partners) for more details. We'll be happy to talk to you.

# Note on SAFETY

Please note that while we will do our absolute best to release technology that is SAFE, and we will do our best to warn you of all possible dangers relating to the technology, it's important to remember that our work is a large experiment. Safety when dealing with hydrogen gas, lithium batteries, motors, and racing vehicles is absolutely critical. You and your organization should develop your OWN safety plan in addition to any safety plans we publically release.

The [Creative Commons License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode) states that we don't accept any responsibility for unforseen issues that arise from our technology. That is to say, SAFETY IS ON YOU.

However, we aren't heartless people. If you find a serious safety issue with our engineering. We want to know ASAP so we can fix it. That's the spirit of open source. We will make mistakes, but we'll also fix them together. So we can't offer any compensation for any safety issues that may arise, but we promise to work with you in good faith to fix them. Work with us, and we'll work with you. Report any concerns to [l2f@mit.edu](mailto:l2f@mit.edu) with the subject line "SAFETY."

Suggestions to improve the safety of our system are ALWAYS welcome. Suggestions should be sent to [l2f@mit.edu](mailto:l2f@mit.edu).
