<p>Hereâ€™s a short video of us installing the motor and transmission onto the newly painted frame!</p>

<p>We started by taking the bike apart entirely at the beginning of this week. Painted the frame, swing arm, wheels, and a few other misc components. Replaced the swing arm bearings and spacers, and re-lubricated the steering column when it went back together. We still need to bleed and connect the brakes, and mount the new chain drive. The battery and hydrogen fuel cell are to come soon, as well as the telemetry system and bodywork!</p>
