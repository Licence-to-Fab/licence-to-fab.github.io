I"j<p>We’re super excited to be partnering with Ducati Motor Holding! Ducati combines skill, design, passion, and a long racing pedigree to make some of the best motorcycles in the world. They’re a standard for both design and engineering, and they’re a company that we look up to in our own work.</p>

<p>Our journey with Ducati started from the very early stages of our project. The bike we acquired to convert to hydrogen power is a Ducati 900ss from the 1999-2000 era. A few months later we acquired another Ducati, a 750ss from the same era, to use as an evaluation bike. We love working on these bikes, they’re spacious, easy to work on, well-engineered, and beautiful to look at. Now we’re super excited to be working with Ducati further as we evaluate hydrogen power for use in race bikes, and touring bikes.</p>

<p>Together, we hope to build robust solutions to the climate crisis while maintaining the characteristics we love about motorcycles, and racing. We think this partnership is key to truly making an impact in the world of motorcycling, and we’re super excited to see what it means for the future of transportation, and the planet.</p>
