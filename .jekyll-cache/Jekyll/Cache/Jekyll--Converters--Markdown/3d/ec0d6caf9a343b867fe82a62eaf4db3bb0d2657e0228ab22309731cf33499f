<p>We have a Motorcycle Dynamometer! Dynamometers are used to determine the performance and efficiency of motorcycle systems and also allow the user to tune the performance to the desired specifications. We own and operate a dynamometer which we allow <strong>MIT community members, Cambridge community members, and high-schools to access</strong> depending on availability.</p>
