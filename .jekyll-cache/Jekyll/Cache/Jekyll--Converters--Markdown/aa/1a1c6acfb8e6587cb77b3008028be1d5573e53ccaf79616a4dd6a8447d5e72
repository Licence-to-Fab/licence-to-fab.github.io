<p>Let’s cut to the chase.</p>

<p>As a society, we need to find ways to reduce our carbon footprint in pretty much all of our activities. Focusing on impoving our climate won’t just improve the well-being of the animals, and plants that share this planet with us, but will help mitigate multitudes of disaster for millions around the world. Sea level rise, crop failures due to drought, and a new breed of superstorms are part of a new, and terrifying reality faced by communities, even today.</p>

<p>We can also agree that transportation is up there on the list of great challenges. Battery-powered Electric Vehicles (BEVs) initially promised to be the solution to internal combustion, but long charge times, and general safety and environmental concers surrounding the use of Lithum made us realize that Lithum was more of a starting point. It was a stop on the road to something bigger. We believe the ‘something bigger’ is hydrogen based on its successful use in fuel cells, and its high energy density (120 MJ/kg).</p>

<p>So, in one sentence, what do we want to do?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We want to build the first ever truly open-source, well-documented, rigorously-tested, hydrogen-powered engine to facilitate the development of hydrogen vehicles to bring us towards a more carbon negative future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another issue we identified in our research is the fact that no good, centralized knowledge-base exists for the development of hydrogen vehicles. Information is generally proprietary, confusing, or unclear. Therefor, we also wish to serve as a central knowledge-base, combining information on hydrogen, presenting and verifying design methodologies for vehicles in order to facilitate development and discussion.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All our designs, data, and results will be open-sourced including drawbacks, limitations, failures, and errors because if we cannot admit our flaws, how will we be able to learn?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, we seek to verify our technology in the real world and on the racetrack. We seek to push our builds to the limits of what they are capable of to craft a truly awesome power unit. Performance, reliability, and efficiency will be at the core of what we do.</p>

<h2 id="white-paper-on-hydrogen-fuel-cell-vehicle-design">White-paper on Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicle Design</h2>

<p>Read our <a href="https://pcb.mit.edu/lectures/lecture_01/FINAL%20PAPER%20PDF.pdf">white paper</a> from the 2.70 FUNdaMENTALs of Precision Product Design Class in Septemeber of 2022.</p>

<h2 id="research-areas-identified">Research areas identified.</h2>

<p>We work in four key research areas we identified based on market research and literature review of the field of hydrogen-powered vehicles (see the above white-paper).</p>

<h3 id="hydrogen">Hydrogen</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>We believe that using rigorous engineering and science, we can build a cleaner future. We have a passion for speed, and an understanding that this does not have to clash with our goals to be a carbon negative society. And through motorsport we seek to push renewable technologies to the limit, to develop the power unit of the future. We want this power unit to be affordable, fully open-source, and be proven on the most aggressive testbed known to humankind—the racetrack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But, most of us are also racing enthusiasts, and that seems to clash. But it doesn’t have to.</p>

<p>As an organization, we choose to focus on the postive, to focus on hope. We seek to take a nuanced approach to reducing our carbon footprint that is context-aware, and culturally-sensitive. We wish to inspire, and instill hope. We CAN do this, together.</p>

<p>User experience is about how a user interacts with, and experiences, a particular product, system or service. As a UX designer, you should consider the Why, What and How of product use.</p>

<p>The What addresses the things people can do with a product—its functionality. Finally, the How relates to the design of functionality in an accessible and aesthetically pleasant way. UX designers start with the Why before determining the What and then, finally, the How in order to create products that users can form meaningful experiences with. In software designs, you will need to ensure the product’s “substance” comes through an existing device and offers a seamless, fluid experience.</p>

<p>Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating markup then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.</p>

<h2 id="we-seek-to-innovate--inspire">We seek to innovate + inspire.</h2>

<p>A Design System is a set of interconnected patterns and shared practices coherently organized to aid in digital product design and development of products such as apps or websites.</p>

<p>There are two primary jobs involved in creating a website: the web designer and web developer, who often work closely together on a website. The web designers are responsible for the visual aspect, which includes the layout, coloring and typography of a web page.</p>

<ul>
  <li>User experience research</li>
  <li>Visual design and illustration</li>
  <li>Programming and coding</li>
</ul>

<p>Web designers will also have a working knowledge of markup languages such as HTML and CSS, although the extent of their knowledge will differ from one web designer to another.</p>
