I"ž<p>We have a new home in MITâ€™s building N52! Welcome to room 318k in the Milkdrop Shop at the <a href="https://edgerton.mit.edu">MIT Edgerton Center</a>. This is our new home-base of operations alongside <a href="http://d-lab.mit.edu">MIT D-Lab</a> and <a href="http://miters.mit.edu">MITERS</a>.</p>

<p>Our new space provides a safe location for experimentation with fuel cells, hydrogen gas, lithium batteries, and vehicle power trains. MITERS and MIT D-Lab will still be the main locations for mechanical fabrication, welding, and other assembly of the bike and its subsystems, but a room of our own means we can work on electronics without worrying about putting others in harmâ€™s way. Safety will always be our top priority on this team, and now we can experiment in a controlled, isolated environment so we can determine what is and isnâ€™t safe.</p>
