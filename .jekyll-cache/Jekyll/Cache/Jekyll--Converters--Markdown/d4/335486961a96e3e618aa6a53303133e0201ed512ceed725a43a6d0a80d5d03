<p>After a few months of work we’re really excited to announce our version 1 battery system and its associated documentation! It’s worth noting that this first version battery system is a <em>prototype system</em> that’s mainly intended for us to collect data during the initial stages of research. It will be followed by a more complete, optimized, and detailed battery design within the next 6 months that’s based on data collected from version 1, performance requirements of the vehicle, as well as simulation.</p>

<h3 id="version-1-essbattery-specifications">Version 1 ESS/Battery Specifications</h3>
<ul>
  <li>System Voltage: 50V (12s)</li>
  <li>System Capacity: 32Ah</li>
  <li>Cells: SPIM08HP (16Ah)</li>
  <li>Configuration: 12s2p</li>
</ul>

<p>The associated documentation is split into two main components, detailed information on specifically the version 1 battery system itself, and tools developed for general battery systems development. Documentation specific to the version 1 ESS includes documentation on cell choices, mechanical design and structure, BMS system setup, and Mechanical CAD of the battery. This documentation is intended for <em>hobbyists to replicate this battery for use in light-duty electric vehicle systems.</em></p>

<p>Tools developed for general battery systems development include a document outlining cell internal resistance measurement, and methods for pack and module-level resistance matching to optimize battery performance. We have also released a <strong>Python script that can take cell resistance data as an input, and output a resistance-matched pack configuration.</strong> The output is not optimal, but we will develop the tool further for release in the next version. It is likely good enough for most applications on <strong>Solar Car and FSAE teams, or hobby-grade vehicles.</strong> But, it should likely not be used for commercial application at the moment.</p>

<p><strong>Please note that contributions to our documentation, and suggested edits for clarity or function are always welcome.</strong></p>
