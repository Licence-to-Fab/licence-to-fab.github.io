<p>In the simplest terms, our research goals as a group focus on making Hydrogen work in the real world, and we mean this across their entire implementation-chain. Our full 2023 report on our research goals is linked below, but a short summary of the main points is presented here.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Much academic research into Hydrogen vehicles is evaluated in simulation due to the high cost to develop and accurately test hardware.</li>
  <li>Few educational opportunities exist for students to get hands-on experience in Hydrogen (vehicles or otherwise).</li>
  <li>Infrastructure development is critical, but stalled due to the lack of demand-side applications, many of which are in the prototype stage, and are seeing slow adoption in new applications.</li>
  <li>Demonstration projects by the <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-need-for-net-zero-demonstration-projects">IEA’s definition</a> focusing on hydrogen are slim, and more focus is needed to make Hydrogen systems a reality.</li>
</ul>

<p>So while we wish to develop vehicle technology to the point of implementation, our research will take into consideration the broader contexts of infrastructure, and resource development for research and education. <strong>Our focus will be to ground ourselves in implementation plans such as the IEA’s Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 plan.</strong></p>
