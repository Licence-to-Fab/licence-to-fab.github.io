<p>Our focus on <strong>fabrication</strong> is critical to –&gt; why do we focsu on this, why do we want to share it (the world is increasingly moving away from trage-based careers but we thinks its critical and could create jobs and skills for people to become bettter engineers and career parts in the future)</p>

<h1 id="we-offer-programs-for-high-school-students-grades-9-12">We offer programs for high-school students grades 9-12.</h1>

<h2 id="high-school-summer-internships">High School Summer Internships</h2>

<p>A significant amount of our vehicle development and testing occurs during the summer months. During this time our team members have more time to focus on mentoring super-awesome high school students who want to gain experience in vehicle development and rigorous engineering design. We accept a few high school students every year who want to help us build the future of transportation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Any high school student grades 9-12, that goes to school in either Cambridge, Boston, or a neighboring community is welcome to take part in our summer internship program.</li>
  <li>If interested, <a href="mailto:l2f@mit.edu">reach out to us via email</a> with a resume, and engineering portfolio (list of projects).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note, due to funding constraints, summer internships are un-paid at the moment. We also do not offer housing or any other form of compensation.</strong></p>

<h2 id="high-school-visits--tours">High School Visits + Tours</h2>

<p>To inspire the next generation of innovators, we are always open to sharing the work we do. We want to inspire, by showing that we can use rigorous and creative engineering to solve even large, climate-related problems. We offer shop tours, school presentations, and more! Just <a href="mailto:l2f@mit.edu">reach out to us</a> and let’s see what we can setup together!</p>

<h1 id="we-offer-additional-help-to-our-community-members">We offer additional help to our community members.</h1>

<p>While we want to offer workshops on engineering design, motorcycle maintenance, technical workshops, and more in the future to people of all ages, we simply do not have the resources at the moment. While we work on getting these resoruces, we do offer help for any projects from the MIT or Cambridge community that we think we can help with <strong>if our schedule permits</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a motorcycle and are having trouble repairing it or want to learn more about maintenance of gasoline, electric, or hybrid motorcycles?</li>
  <li>Have a project that uses motors, motor control, batteries, instrumentation, or power electronics for vehicles or similar systems?</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="we-offer-access-to-general-resources-for-vehicle-development">We offer access to general resources for vehicle development.</h1>

<p>We offer the following general resources for vehicle development that the MIT and Cambridge community can access.</p>

<p>We have a Motorcycle Dynamometer! Dynamometers are used to determine the performance and efficiency of motorcycle systems and also allow the user to tune the performance to the desired specifications. We own and operate a dynamometer which we allow <strong>MIT community members, Cambridge community members, and high-schools to access</strong> depending on availability.</p>

<p><strong>Dynamometer Model—</strong> Dynojet 250i Motorcycle Chassis Dynamometer</p>

<ul>
  <li>750 Horsepower max torque</li>
  <li>200 Miles-per-hour max speed</li>
  <li>Eddy current brake absorption + inertial loading</li>
