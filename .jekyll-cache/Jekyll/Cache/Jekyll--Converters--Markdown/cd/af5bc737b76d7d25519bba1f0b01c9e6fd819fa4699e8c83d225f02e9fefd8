<p>Since we‚Äôre producing documentation, sometimes we will link to resources on the internet that can better explain certain concepts than we can. Or we‚Äôll link to places where we purchased materials required for our work. We are in no way taking credit for any of the work in any of these links, they are to help you.</p>
