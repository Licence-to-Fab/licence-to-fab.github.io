<p><strong>Licence to Fab</strong> isn‚Äôt just our name, it‚Äôs an ideology. Fabrication, to us, represents the ability to make anything you can dream of with your own two hands. This focus on considering ‚Äúhow to build things really well‚Äù while desinging them, allows us to do the creative, ground-breaking work we do.</p>

<p>More and more, the world is moving away from teaching fabrication in favor of more ‚Äúcomputational‚Äù methods. Fewer high-schools have ‚Äúshop‚Äù classes that teach students how to fix cars, or build things in general. So since fabrication is so core to what we do, we want to offer the ability to learn those skills to our local community. We believe fabrication teaches you the detailed, rigorous, physics-based, creative engineering required to understand and solve world problems. <strong>And we want to offer the ability to learn that to anyone regardless of race, gender, economic status, or educational background.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We want to inspire people to make the world a better place, and give them the knowledge and tools to do so. We want to give them the ability to build solutions to the problems they see with their own two hands.</p>

<p>Come build a better world with us &lt;3.</p>

<h1 id="we-offer-programs-for-high-school-students-grades-9-12">We offer programs for high-school students grades 9-12.</h1>

<h2 id="high-school-summer-internships">High School Summer Internships</h2>

<p>A significant amount of our vehicle development and testing occurs during the summer months. During this time our team members have more time to focus on mentoring super-awesome high school students who want to gain experience in vehicle development and rigorous engineering design. We accept a few high school students every year who want to help us build the future of transportation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Any high school student grades 9-12, that goes to school in either Cambridge, Boston, or a neighboring community is invited to come work with us over the summer.</li>
  <li>If interested, <a href="mailto:l2f@mit.edu">reach out to us via email</a> with a resume, and engineering portfolio (list of projects).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note, due to funding constraints, summer internships are un-paid at the moment. We also do not offer housing or any other form of compensation.</strong></p>

<h2 id="on-site-high-school-visits--l2f-shop-tours">On-Site High School Visits + L2F Shop Tours</h2>

<p>To inspire the next generation of innovators, we are always open to sharing the work we do. We want to showcase how we can use rigorous and creative engineering to solve even large-scale problems. Come take a tour of our shop on the MIT campus, or have us come to your school to give a presentation! Just <a href="mailto:l2f@mit.edu">reach out to us</a> and let‚Äôs see what we can setup together!</p>

<h1 id="we-offer-additional-help-to-our-community-members">We offer additional help to our community members.</h1>

<p>While we want to offer workshops on engineering design, motorcycle maintenance, technical workshops, and more in the future to people of all ages, we simply do not have the resources at the moment. While we work on getting these resoruces, we do offer help for any projects from the MIT or Cambridge community that we think we can help with <strong>if our schedule permits</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a motorcycle and are having trouble repairing it or want to learn more about maintenance of gasoline, electric, or hybrid motorcycles?</li>
  <li>Have a project that uses motors, motor control, batteries, instrumentation, or power electronics for vehicles or similar systems?</li>
  <li>Have general design or fabrication questions regarding metal-working, welding, CNC machining, sheet-metal forming, casting, or other processes?</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of these apply to you, we encourage you to reach out to <a href="mailto:l2f@mit.edu">l2f@mit.edu</a>! We will do our best to help.</p>

<p>We have a Motorcycle Dynamometer! Dynamometers are used to determine the performance and efficiency of motorcycle systems and also allow the user to tune the performance to the desired specifications. We own and operate a dynamometer which we allow <strong>MIT community members, Cambridge community members, and high-schools to access</strong> depending on availability.</p>
