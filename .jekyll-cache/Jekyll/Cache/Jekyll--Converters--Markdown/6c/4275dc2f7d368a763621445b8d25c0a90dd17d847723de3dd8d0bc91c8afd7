<p>We establish key partnerships with industry, and within academia to further our mission to enable the development of hydrogen-powered vehicles. This is absolutely critical to the work we do, we cannot hope to reframe the way industry thinks about vehicle power systems without fully understanding the issues relating to developing green transportation from the people actually developing it. Our partners aren‚Äôt just sponsors, we work directly with them, and their core engineering teams to share knowledge and limitations, openly and fairly.</p>
