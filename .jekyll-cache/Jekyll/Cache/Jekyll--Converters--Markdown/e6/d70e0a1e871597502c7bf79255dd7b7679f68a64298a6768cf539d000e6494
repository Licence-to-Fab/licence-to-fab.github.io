<p>A hugeeeeee thank you goes to Madhouse Motors from Boston, MA today for selling us this amazing Ducati 900ss track bike! And her name is ‘toothless’ based on her resemblence to our favorite animated dragon!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We will modify this motorcycle by adding a high-capacity lithum battery, hydrogen fuel cell, electric motors, and associated power electronics to prove the efficacy of hydrogen powered vehicles in the real world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We chose a motorcyle as the desired vehicle to modify (first, because we love motorcycles) but also because motorcycles are incredibally light-weight vehicles and get significantly better fuel efficiency on average than a typical car. They also have some contraints on size that are challenging when approaching the system-design of a hydrogen engine. We thought this made a motorcycle the perfect test-bed for the initial stages of our project, and one that we could scale up to larger vehicles.</p>

<p>Say hello to toothless!</p>
