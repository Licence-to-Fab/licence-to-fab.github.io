I"þ<p>Weâ€™re super excited to announce our partnership with Doosan Mobility Innovation (DMI)! DMI is a leader in small-scale fuel cell technology and has lots of experience developing fuel cells for agricultural and industrial drones.</p>

<p>Our goal is to develop a hybrid battery/hydrogen fuel-cell motorcycle as a proof of concept for hydrogen vehicles, and to develop and prove a design methodology for hydrogen vehicles to publish it open-source. For the first version of our prototype, weâ€™ll be using <a href="https://www.doosanmobility.com/en/products/powerpack-dm15/">Doosanâ€™s DM/DP15 Fuel Cell Power Pack</a> because of its small scale but high power output.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re comitted to working in detail with Doosan engineers to realize the prototype and concept in hardware. Along the way, Doosan engineers alongside our team will address many challenges for small-scale hydrogen vehicles while also addressing critical safety standards for these vehicles.</p>

<p>Thanks so much Doosan! Weâ€™re looking forward to working with you!</p>
