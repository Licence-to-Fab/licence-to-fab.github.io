<p>Let’s cut to the chase.</p>

<p>As a society, we need to find ways to reduce our carbon footprint in pretty much all of our activities. Focusing on impoving our climate won’t just improve the well-being of the animals, and plants that share this planet with us, but will help mitigate multitudes of disaster for millions around the world. Sea level rise, crop failures due to drought, and the latest breed of superstorms are part of a new, and terrifying reality faced by communities, even today.</p>

<p>We can also agree that transportation is up there on the list of great challenges. Battery-powered Electric Vehicles (BEVs) initially promised to be the solution to internal combustion, but long charge times, and general safety and environmental concerns surrounding the use of Lithum made us realize that Lithum was more of a starting point. It was a stop on the road to something bigger. We believe the ‘something bigger’ is hydrogen based on its successful use in fuel cells, and its high energy density (120 MJ/kg).</p>

<p>So, in one sentence, what do we want to do?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We want to build the first ever truly open-source, well-documented, rigorously-tested, hydrogen-powered engine to facilitate the development of hydrogen vehicles to bring us towards a more carbon negative future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another issue we identified in our research, is the fact that no good, centralized knowledge-base exists for the development of hydrogen vehicles. Information is generally proprietary, confusing, or unclear. Therefor, we also wish to serve as a central knowledge-base, combining information on hydrogen, while presenting and verifying design methodologies for vehicles in order to facilitate development and discussion.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All our designs, data, and results will be open-sourced including drawbacks, limitations, failures, and errors because if we cannot admit our flaws, how will we be able to learn?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we’re going to build engines, and integrate them into vehicles. Then we will seek to push our builds to the limits of what they are capable of to craft a truly awesome power unit. Performance, reliability, and efficiency will be at the core of what we do. And safety is paramount. Then we will publish the results for individuals, and organizations to use, free-of-charge.</p>

<h2 id="white-paper-on-hydrogen-fuel-cell-vehicle-design">White-paper on Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicle Design</h2>

<p>Read our <a href="https://pcb.mit.edu/lectures/lecture_01/FINAL%20PAPER%20PDF.pdf">white paper</a> from the 2.70 FUNdaMENTALs of Precision Product Design Class in the Fall of 2022. As stated in the paper, we seek to develop an end-to-end design methodology for hydrogen powered vehicles, and verify it on real hardware.</p>

<h1 id="we-work-in-the-following-research-areas">We work in the following research areas.</h1>

<p>We work in four key research areas we identified based on market research, and literature review of the field of hydrogen-powered vehicles (see the above white-paper).</p>

<h3 id="hydrogen-fuel-cell-technology-storage-and-production">Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technology, Storage, and Production</h3>

<p>Fuel Cells are expensive, especially PEM fuel cells. We want to use intelligent manufacturing and scaling to make the techology more acessible, and improve their efficiency and energy density. Hydrogen storage on vehicles must be secure and safe; we seek to improve on current methods to ensure safe operation of these vehicles. Hydrogen generation is difficult, green hydrogen generation more so. We seek to understand the methods of green hydrogen generation and attempt to improve upon them.</p>

<p>We will not be looking into Hydrogen Combustion at this time. Combustion produces harmful greenhouse gasses.</p>

<h3 id="power-storage">Power Storage</h3>

<p>The limitations of hydrogen fuel cells (such as a lack of regenerative braking capacity) are often mitigated by the use of a power storage element such as a lithium battery. Is it our belief that the hybrid combination of storage element and a hydrogen fuel cell can lead to a more effective power train. We want to look into supercapacitors as an alternative to lithium batteries and help develop a set of associated, open-source power electronics for the integration of super capacitors with hydrogen fuel cells.</p>

<h3 id="powertrains-motors--motor-control">Powertrains, Motors, + Motor Control</h3>

<p>Higher efficiency motor and motor controller designs that can provide the same mechanical power output at greater efficiencies would allow a significant reduction in the required size of fuel cells and storage elements in a vehicle system. This would make the technology more compact, less expensive, and more practical to implement. Therefor we want to look into efficient electric motor and inverter design, as well as optimal gear ratios and transmissions for vehicles.</p>

<p><strong>We will establish key partnerships within industry and academia in an effort to achieve the listed research goals.</strong></p>

<h1 id="we-want-to-prove-our-work-on-the-racetrack-and-in-the-real-world">We want to prove our work on the racetrack and in the real world.</h1>

<p>We’re going to build real things, starting with racing vehicles and moving to more practical vehicles in the future. It’s no secret that racing has produced many innovations that make consumer cars more efficient, and has produced a deeper understanding of vehicles in general. As of 2022, our first project will be a hydrogen-powered motorcycle that will ideally be entered in compeition sometime in the year 2024.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We believe that using rigorous engineering and science, we can build a cleaner future. We have a passion for speed, and an understanding that this does not have to clash with our goals to be a carbon negative society. And through motorsport we seek to push renewable technologies to the limit, to develop the power unit of the future. We want this power unit to be affordable, fully open-source, and be proven on the most aggressive testbed known to humankind—the racetrack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We will learn from each project and each race through detailed analysis, and data collection which will also be provided open-source to the community. We will focus on performance, and on practicality as well.</p>

<p><strong>And we will do this with the attention to detail, and craftsmanship that comes with a licence to fab.</strong></p>
