<p>We establish key partnerships with industry, and within academia to further our mission to enable the development of hydrogen-powered vehicles. This is absolutely critical to the work we do, we cannot hope to reframe the way industry thinks about vehicle power systems without fully understanding the issues relating to developing green transportation from the people actually developing it. Our partners aren’t just sponsors, we work directly with them, and their core engineering teams to share knowledge and limitations, openly and fairly.</p>

<h2 id="our-current-organizational-needs">Our current organizational needs.</h2>

<p>We focus on building partnerships with companies that are addressing our key areas of research in energy storage, hydrogen fuel cell development, hydrogen production and storage, powertrains and motor control, and vehicle development. Currently we are focusing on building partnerships in the following areas.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Hydrogen Fuel Cell Manfacturing + Design</strong>, we are looking to work with organizations or academic institutions with experience in Hydrogen Fuel Cell production and design to increase the efficacy of fuel cells and reduce their cost of manufacturing.</li>
  <li><strong>Hydrogen Generation + Storage</strong>, we are looking to work with organizations or academic institutions with experience in Hydrogen Generation and Storage to develop safety standards for hydrogen vehicles and further research into the production of green hydrogen for vehicles.</li>
  <li><strong>Powertrains + Motor Control</strong>, we are looking to work with organizations or academic institutions with experience in motors and motor control to develop more efficient power trains tuned for application.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, we are looking for partners that can provide the following to support our organization’s work.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Logistics Support</strong>,</li>
  <li><strong>Hydrogen Fuel Supply</strong>,</li>
  <li><strong>General Funding</strong>,</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please note, we will not accept partnerships from fossil fuel companies, oil companies, or similar organizations as part of our pledge to support <a href="https://www.mit-divest.com">MIT Divest</a>. We also refuse to be supported by fast-fashion brands, or other environmentally damaging brands that we believe do not align with our values to build a cleaner world. We actively seek to be supported by organizations making a concious effort to produce a more equitable world for all people regardless of race or gender.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That being said, we are comitted to working with organizations that are actively seeking to improve their green-technology plan, and reduce their carbon footprint.</p>
