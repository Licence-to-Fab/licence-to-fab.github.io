MITERS is a student-run shop on campus that's responsible for many crazy creations. It is also our home. The hydrogen bike project started out of MITERS, and we continue to have a close relationship with the society. Learn more about MITERS [here.](http://miters.mit.edu)

Every so-often we get a new edition of the [MITERS Journal](http://miters.mit.edu/miters-journal/) where members write up all their crazy projects to share with the world! Check out the [Fall 2022 Edition](http://miters.mit.edu/large_media/MITERS_Journal_Fall_2022.pdf) to see some info on the hydrogen bike project!
