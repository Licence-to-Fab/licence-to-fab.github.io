L2F hydrogen racing started as a class project for the [MIT 2.70 FUNdaMENTALs of Precision Product Design](https://web.mit.edu/2.70/) class and has grown into a MIT student team focusing on building a cleaner future with hydrogen. We are a re-vamping of MIT's Electric Vehicle team which has a long history of research into renewable energy and electric powered vehicles both in the performance and practical spheres.

Initially the goal was to build something cool, but through research for the project we found that sources and knowledge-bases for hydrogen-powered vehicles were limited in scope and much of the details of the technology were generally proprietary. At the end of a [prelminary white-paper](/papers/Motorcycle-Design-White-Paper-PDF.pdf) written for the class, we concluded that a project that focused on an open-source hydrogen engine would be important to building a cleaner future.

> Our goal with this project is to develop a platform to analyze the performance and potential of Hydrogen Fuel Cell that can serve as a robust test bed for future development towards alternatives to BEVs. What we really want to create is a open-source knowledge base. A base that others can use to develop this technology even further to implementation. The open-source community has solved many of the world’s challenges in the past by sharing knowledge and collaborating on difficult problems—we believe this is necessary right now for the realization of FCEVs.

Over the next year we hope to realize our design as a fully assembled motorcycle and verify our design methodology on the track. We have also identified key future research areas.

> We plan to run the following experiments using the hardware platform described above—and publish the data open-source.
>
> - Verification of the claim “we never need to charge the battery off the wall, we only need to fill the tank with hydrogen” for a set of practical scenarios. 
> - Verification of the performance of the bike system as compared to the predicted performance in III as a test of the design methodology. 
> - Test of the bike’s regenerative braking capabilities to recover energy used for acceleration during braking, and a test of the speed at which the fuel cell could continuously power the bike at steady-state. 
> 
> We plan to look into the following alternatives to make hydrogen fuel cell more accessible as an alternative to BEVs—and publish the results open-source.
> 
> - The use of a bank of super-capacitors and associated power electronics instead of a large lithium battery in a system similar to Figure 9a. This may help with the long charging times and negative environmental impact of Lithium [25].
> - Large-scale manufacturing cost of FCEV power units and PEM membranes, technologies for manufacturing, and alternatives to PEM cells [22].
> - Higher efficiency motor and motor control designs for equivalent power output at lower power draw [26].
