We have a new home in MIT's building N52! Welcome to room 318K in the Milkdrop Shop at the [MIT Edgerton Center](https://edgerton.mit.edu). This is our new home-base of operations alongside [MIT D-Lab](http://d-lab.mit.edu) and [MITERS](http://miters.mit.edu).

Our new space provides a safe location for experimentation with fuel cells, hydrogen gas, lithium batteries, and vehicle power trains. MITERS and MIT D-Lab will still be the main locations for mechanical fabrication, welding, and other assembly of the bike and its subsystems, but a room of our own means we can work on electronics without worrying about putting others in harm's way. Safety will always be our top priority on this team, and now we can experiment in a controlled, isolated environment so we can determine what is and isn't safe. 

Check out the video tour of our new space!

Our new space has many fun features!
- Large wooden benches set aside for working
- A [motorcycle dynamometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamometer) (construction in progress) that will allow us to perform full-system powertrain characterizations without leaving the lab
- Electrical testing equipment, power supplies, electronic loads, and more that allow us to characterize the fuel cell, batteries, and test the bike's electrical systems
- Space for storage of our sensitive components, tools, and more!

Wanna come say hi? We're ususally around on Saturdays! Come check out the space and meet the team!
