We're super excited to announce our partnership with Doosan Mobility Innovation (DMI)! DMI is a leader in small-scale fuel cell technology and has lots of experience developing fuel cells for agricultural and industrial drones. 

Our goal is to develop a hybrid battery/hydrogen fuel-cell motorcycle as a proof of concept for hydrogen vehicles, and to develop and prove a design methodology for hydrogen vehicles to publish it open-source. For the first version of our prototype, we'll be using [Doosan's DM/DP15 Fuel Cell Power Pack](https://www.doosanmobility.com/en/products/powerpack-dm15/) because of its small scale but high power output.

We're comitted to working in detail with Doosan engineers to realize the prototype and concept in hardware. Along the way, Doosan engineers alongside our team will address many challenges for small-scale hydrogen vehicles while also addressing critical safety standards for these vehicles.

Thanks so much Doosan! We're looking forward to working with you!
