# Version 1 Bike (2022-2023)

Documentation for the Version 1 bike is coming soon.

# Initial Documentation (v0) 

Documentation in this section includes the initial feasibility studies for the design of a hydrogen powered motorcycle, and the evalulation against other powertrains, and technologies. Please note that from the initial documentation to version 1, some parts of the system changed during the development of the platform so parts of the below white-papers are outdated but still serve as good references for design.
