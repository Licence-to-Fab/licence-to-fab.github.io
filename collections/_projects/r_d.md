# Current Longer-Term Research Projects

Our longer-term research projects won't see integration on our vehicle platforms for at least a year or so, but the are critical to the future. We think we can make vehicles even more sustainable, practical, and accessible, and these projects will help us get there. 

## Engineering Research

- Integration of Super-Capacitors
- Active Power Management Systems
- Open-Source Fuel Cell
- Low-Energy, High-Performance Liquid Cooling System
- System-Level Simulation of Hydrogen Racing Vehicles
- Aerodynamic Design of Efficient Vehicles 
- Controls Systems for High Power + High Efficiency Driving Modes
- Extension of Research to Larger Vehicles

## Environmental Impact Research

- Green Hydrogen Sourcing Standards + Supply Chain
- Green Manufacturing of Hydrogen Vehicles

## Safety

- Failure Analysis for Hydrogen Vehicles
- Development of General Safety Standards + Design Methodology for Hydrogen Vehicles
