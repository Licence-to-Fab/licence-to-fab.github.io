# Ghost Rider Tim's Engineering Calculators 

The following Excel Spreadsheets were developed by our team for our own engineering work. We are open-sourcing these calculators for public use to enable others to design safe, and reliable systems. **Please note that these calculators come with reccomended reading resources, that we HIGHLY reccomend you review before using these calculators.**

# Engineering Resources

The following are resources for general engineering that we compiled for our work. Please note that we only publish resources which are freely avaliable online or have been open-sourced. For books that don't have PDFs linked you will likely have to purchase them, or gain access through your local/university library.
